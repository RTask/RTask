# Hacktoberfest
This project is a fresh Django project. It should work like any other ticketing system. This is the same project I mentioned in my hacktoberfest video https://youtu.be/a7eTy9lPeJ4

# RTask
RTask is a ticketing system written in python on top of Django.
## Running (simplified)

1. Clone the repo, if you haven't already, and `cd` to it
`git clone https://github.com/RTask/RTask.git`
`cd RTask/`

2. Install dependencies.
`python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Run app
`python3 rtask/manage.py runserver`
